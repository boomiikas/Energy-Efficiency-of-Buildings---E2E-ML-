# 🏠 Energy Efficiency Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts **Heating Load (Y1)** using an optimized **XGBoost Regressor** model.  
The dataset includes building characteristics such as compactness, wall area, roof area, and glazing properties.

---

## 📊 Features Used
- **X1 Relative Compactness**
- **X3 Wall Area**
- **X5 Overall Height**
- **X6 Orientation**
- **X7 Glazing Area**
- **X8 Glazing Area Distribution**

## 🎯 Target Variable
- **Y1 Heating Load**

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pickle** (for model deployment)
